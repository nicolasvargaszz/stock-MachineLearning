Welcome to the **Intelligent Inventory Management** project, designed to optimize inventory processes for a fabric retail company in Paraguay using machine learning. This project aims to enhance inventory forecasting and management through advanced data analysis and predictive modeling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure: CRISP-DM

The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which consists of six key steps:

### 1. Market Understanding
- **Objective**: Gain insights into the fabric retail market in Paraguay to understand inventory dynamics and business needs.
- **Activities**: Conduct market research, analyze sales trends, and identify key factors influencing inventory requirements.

### 2. Data Understanding
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical sales data, inventory records, and other relevant datasets.
- **Initial Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, outliers, and data quality issues.
- **Problem Identification**: Recognize data-related challenges such as missing values, inconsistencies, and limitations in data coverage.

### 3. Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inaccuracies in the dataset.
- **Feature Transformation**: Apply techniques to transform and normalize variables for better model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify and select relevant features that significantly impact inventory forecasting.
- **Data Splitting**: Create training and testing datasets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Modeling
- **Technique Selection**: Choose appropriate modeling techniques based on the nature of the data and business goals.
- **Model Training**: Train various models to predict inventory needs and sales trends.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
- **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to ensure robust and reliable model performance.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Model Assessment**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Results Interpretation**: Analyze the results to understand model strengths and limitations.
- **Iteration**: Refine models and processes based on evaluation results and feedback.

### 6. Deployment
- **Solution Implementation**: Deploy the final model into a production environment for real-time inventory management.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor model performance and update it as needed to adapt to changing market conditions.

## üìà Summary

The project employs various methodologies to achieve optimal results in inventory management:

- **Predictive Models and Regression**: Initially, we used scikit-learn to apply predictive modeling and regression techniques. While these methods provided valuable insights, they did not yield optimal results.
- **Facebook Prophet**: We subsequently implemented Facebook Prophet, a forecasting tool designed for time series data. This approach delivered significantly improved outcomes, demonstrating the effectiveness of Prophet in predicting inventory needs.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and model implementation.
- **scikit-learn**: A library for applying machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- **Facebook Prophet**: A tool for forecasting time series data.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Employed for numerical operations and handling arrays.
